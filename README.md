## What are Mods?

Totems is a modular token standard that separates core token functionality from extensible features through a plugin architecture called **Mods**. Mods are event-driven programs that respond to token events such as transfers, mints, and burns.

Totem creators can mix-and-match mods to create unique token behaviors through an easy UI instead of complex smart contract coding. There is a market for mods that allows mod developers to get paid every time a mod is stacked into a totem.
